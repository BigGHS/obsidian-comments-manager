### Print Mode

Print Mode allows you to temporarily convert hidden comments to visible callouts for PDF export without permanently modifying your files.

#### How to Use Print Mode:

1. **Click the üñ®Ô∏è button** in the Comments panel or use the command "Activate Print Mode"
2. **Preview** how your document will look with comments converted to callouts
3. **Click "Export to PDF"** to trigger PDF export with converted comments
4. **Your original document remains unchanged** - comments are converted temporarily
5. **Click the restoration notice** when you're done to restore the original content

#### Print Mode Features:

- **Safe Operation**: No permanent file modification
- **Preview Modal**: See exactly how comments will appear as callouts
- **Context Awareness**: Callouts include header context and line numbers
- **Manual Control**: You decide when to restore the original content
- **Perfect for**: Academic papers, document reviews, sharing annotated content

### Individual Comment Conversion

Convert specific comments to permanent callouts with custom titles.

#### How to Convert Individual Comments:

1. **Click the üìù button** next to any comment in the panel
2. **Enter a custom title** for the callout (or leave blank for "Comment")
3. **Confirm the conversion** - this permanently replaces the comment with a callout
4. **The comment becomes visible** in both the editor and exported documents

#### Conversion Features:

- **Custom Titles**: Name your callouts with meaningful titles like "Important Note", "Question", "TODO"
- **Permanent Change**: Unlike Print Mode, these conversions are saved to your file
- **Smart Defaults**: If no title is provided, uses "Comment" or context from nearby headers
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental conversions
- **Perfect for**: Making specific feedback visible, highlighting important notes, creating actionable items

### Navigation Behavior

- **Comment Text**: Click to edit in-place in the panel
- **Comment Area**: Click to navigate to the comment location in the document
